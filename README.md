# LOW COST VENTILATOR USING RASPBERRY PI 

# Description
Due to the increasing demands of ventilators in this pandemic,we came up with an idea to make ventilators using IoT based raspberry Pi module.It is expected that this ventilator can be manufactured within short period of time ,effectively reducing the cost.We have used raspberry Pi technology because it can be easily interfaced with the motor and sensor with high processing speed.

We have used Ambubag for ventilation. Basically it has to be pressed manually which requires an external assistance, this can be eliminated by automating the Ambubag with the help of a linear motor.The speed of the motor is controlled by an IR sensor remote, this is to maintain social distance between patient and health workers.

We feel that our idea will be  an effective one to meet up with the shortage of ventilators in this pandemic.
